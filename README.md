# Ethereum Transaction Replay Tool

## Introduction
This project introduces an advanced replay tool for Ethereum, designed to enhance the efficiency of historical transaction analysis through a restructured database that supports parallel execution. The tool focuses on replaying historical Ethereum transactions, optimizing their handling to better meet the analytical demands on Ethereum's network and provide a more effective environment for testing and analysis of smart contracts

## Environment
- Golang version >= 1.19.0

## Project Structure
Core data directory:
+ `research`

## Usage

### Setup
Clone the project and execute the following command to build:
```bash
make all
```


This command compiles the source and generates two executable files in the build/bin directory: `geth` for creating the archival database and `evm` for transaction replay.

1. #### Data Recording
+ Obtain the compiled `geth` from build/bin/geth and copy it to a work directory, for example, `ReplayerSpace`.
  In `ReplayerSpace`, create a JSON file to configure the archival database. Example configuration:
```json
{
"dir": "./",
"Names": [
"account",
"code",
"codeChange",
"storage",
"info"]
}
```
+ Use `geth` to import blockchain data in RLP format:
```bash
./geth --datadir ./geth_data import ./block/0To100w.rlp
```

2. #### Transaction Replay
+ Replay a specific transaction:
```bash
./evm replay blockNumber txIndex
```

+ Replay transactions within a specific block range:
```bash
./evm replay --range startBlockNumber endBlockNumber
```


## Note
This project has been tested up to the first 12 million blocks. Transactions beyond this range have not been experimented with.
